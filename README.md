# TombRaiderOrigins
A compilation of all TR games (1-5) with the TR3 engine (a bit modified, just a bit xD).

# Why the TR3 engine and why all games in one ?

I started thinking it would be nice to regroup all games a will ago when doing TR1 porting in TombEngine,
So i started meddling with TOMB5 from https://github.com/Trxyebeep/TOMB5
but it was full of hack which was impossible to work with :'(
So i switched to https://github.com/Trxyebeep/tomb3 which is the most stable to start it
(and there was the 3D inventory, and the globe which make it a nice level selection xD).
